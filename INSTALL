Building FaTTY requires recent version of gcc and g++ for Cygwin. It can not be
built with a MinGW compiler, because it relies on some Unix facilities that are
not available on plain Windows, in particular pseudo terminal devices (ptys).

To compile, just run 'make'. (Add a -j option as desired.)
To install, simply copy fatty.exe to an appropriate place, e.g. /bin.
